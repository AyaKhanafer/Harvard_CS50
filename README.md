This is a repository containing all the projects I worked on during my CS50 course taught by Harvard.

# 1. Arabic Challenge
This project is an idea of my own but I was inspired by thr "Ivyâ€™s Hardest Game" and "Intersection" games in the course. I also watched a few complementary tutorials online that helped me. 

The principle of the game are as follows: you gain points by touching the Arabic letters with the black sticks that you move thanks to the arrows on your keyboard.You lose a life every time a letter touches a turning wheel. 
This challenge is purposefuly made more challenging by the fact that the arrows the user control move in opposite directions.

This game was developped using Scratch and the code can be found under 1_arabic_challenge.
